Since joining Æthos-Sundai, an ethical-AI-accelerationr slash hacker-foundation-from-Harvard-and-MIT, I've been toying with open-source LLMs. Many projects, apps, etc, tend to be hosted publically, prompting and saving data somewhere in the cloud.

For my first Sundai @ MIT IHQ, I decided to provide simple code for the community to use LLMs in a private manner.

If you have questions regarding open-source ML, feel free to contact me!
